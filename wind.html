            <p>In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should recieve: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.) (John 7:37-39)
                The washing of the water of the word is not only able to cleanse us but it is also the solitary source of soul satisfaction. The Spirit, the water, and the blood agree in one upon the earth. It goes so deep that Jesus said drink my blood and eat my flesh. Feast on Him and drink of His abundance today! Forbidden in the natural, the blood was the very life source of the creature. We are priviledged to partake of the very life and essence of Christ. We imbibe of His goodness, righteousness, and finished work upon the cross and we are joined to Him as part of His body with His very life flowing through our veins. Do you want another plate now? Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled. There is a pure river of water of life flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb. We can connect directly to heavenly flow from the earthly elements that are present: the Spirit, the water and the blood. Through the blood we are redeemed, through the water we are baptized into His death and through the Spirit we are sealed and set apart as His. The Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost are three in one, the Trinity. One God, three persons, two of which connect us to the Father who is in heaven. So distinct that only the Father in heaven knows the exact time of the end, and yet so One that the Father sent the Son and Jesus said yes and went on our behalf. The Holy Ghost in heaven that was not yet given was sent on the day of Pentecost. The Spirit is still in heaven but He has a habitation on the earth also. Christ was upon the earth but is now back in heaven with the Father and He said it was better for Him to go and send us the Spirit. Christ in you is now the hope of glory! Come to Christ and drink!

                In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. (Gen 7:11)
                Out of the overflow of the entire planet came an overflow of waters that brought blessing and enabled the boat of hope to float. The seed of restoration that was buried deep within the ground of disappointment began to rise. On this day God's two edge sword brought a necessary cutting away of the flesh while at the same time the sword brought the healing stitch of redemption. Without Noah's Ark, humanity would not have made it to the cross of Christ at Calvary. The same floods and storms that bring destruction are also able to be sources of blessing and comfort at the same time when God is involved. Psalm 29 says: The Lord sits upon the flood; yea, the Lord sits King forever. It's good to know that the presence of the Lord is with us through the floods and at our lowest and loneliest points in life. At times it seems like evil has the upper hand but when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him. Consider the battle at the river Kishon That ancient river, also called the river of slaughter; could be as low and unassuming as a dry water bed but at is peak could be deep enough to drown an entire army and that is exactly what happened on that day of battle. God more than made up for the laziness and unwillingness of the people to go to battle and He went ahead of the army in victory. When the Lord pours out from above, even the driest soul will be touched, drenched and any thirst will be quenched. Whatever the need or situation may be, seek the Lord for He has you covered! He promises: I will pour upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring. He poured out for Noah, He poured out for Hagar and Ishmael, He poured out for Isreal in the wilderness, He poured out for Samson and He made a way Jonah in the deep waters and He will make a way for you too! Seek the Lord while He may be found, today is the day of salvation, the day of a miracle, the day of a blessing and the day for a breakthrough. For this shall everyone that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him. The windows of heaven are open, the Lord is pouring out, are you postured and ready to receive?

                Oh God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is; (Psalm 63:1)
The woman at the well had nothing to draw water with, she looked and saw that Jesus didn't have anything either and so puzzled she asked: from whence then has thou that living water? Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. Digging a well is not easy and can be a very arduous process but it is well worth the results that the well water supplies once dug. Instead of launching a full on attack on Isaac, the Philistines filled up Isaac's wells that Abraham had dug out with earth. The enemy uses this as a tactic still, he wants us filled with the things of the earth, filled with the things of the flesh, and filled with the world, worries, cares and stress. It was for this very reason that many wells were hidden from view so that only those who knew the exact location could find them. By God's providence Hagar stumbled upon one of these hidden wells before she and Ishmael died of thirst. If you ponder on it, Hagar's life that was connected to Abraham was also a divine well that she happened to stumble upon before being cast out. Isaac did not retaliate when his wells were attacked, instead he stayed focused, he redug the wells and then renamed the wells after the former names. The woman at the well was looking right at the eternal well of life with streams of living water flowing but she could not see it at first. The well of the long awaited Messiah stood before the people of Israel but was hidden from them and they did not recognize or recieve Him. We are to drink of Him but He asked drink of her. The more she communed with Christ, the more her soul awakened to the reality of the Messiah. At the end of the conversation she said to Him; I know that Messiah cometh, which is called Christ: when He is come, he will tell us all things. She then left her waterpot, and went into the city saying: Come, see a man, which told me all things that I ever did: is not this the Christ? Drink of Him!
